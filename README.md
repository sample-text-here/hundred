# hundred

a coding challenge i made for myself; how much
can i fit in one hundred lines or less?

- `server.js` basic http server based off of express
- `templater.js` pre-render your webpages server side
- `data.js` easily extendible database
- `simple.css` css styling for minimal sites
- `chat.js` chat server; connect with netcat. somewhat buggy
