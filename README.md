# hundred

a coding challenge i made for myself; how much
can i fit in one hundred lines or less?

i'll try to keep these understandable and not
mangle/minify them. if you want to use them,
you probrably should edit them to your liking
first.

- `server.js` basic http server based off of express
- `templater.js` pre-render your webpages server side
- `data.js` easily extendible database
- `simple.css` css styling for minimal sites
- `chat.js` chat server; connect with netcat. somewhat buggy
- `request.js` async wrapper for http
- `process.js` sed-like batch text editor
- `tokenize.js` a string tokenizer (numbers, strings, and "words")
- `tictactoe.js` (deno) two player tic-tac-toe game
- `xml.js` xml/html parser
- `p2p.js` sample p2p protocol implementation
